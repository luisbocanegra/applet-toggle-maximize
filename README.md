### Default actions

* Single click `Overview`
* Double click `Window Maximize (toggle)`
* Middle click `Show desktop`
* Wheel Up `Switch to Previous Desktop`
* Wheel Down `Switch to Next Desktop`
* Drag Up `Window Move`
* Drag Down `Window Move`
* Drag Left `Window One Desktop to the Left`
* Drag Right `Window One Desktop to the Right`
* Long Press `Present windows`

## Installing

* Install dependencies (please let me know if I missed something)

  ```txt
    cmake extra-cmake-modules ki18n plasma-framework
  ```

* If installed widget from KDE Store:
  
  Build and install the required plugin only
  
  ```sh
  ./install-plugin-only.sh
  ```

* Otherwise, build/install everything:

  ```sh
  ./install.sh
  ```

### Why building is needed and not just the plasmoid?

* Installing Just the plasmoid with a differend `id` won't work as this widget access some special properties of the panel, which are only avilable to the default applet, having them in other panel requires building the qt plugin too
* Just installing in `./local` without renaming would work but I then there is no way to remove the updated verision from UI and I don't think widgets that mask other widgets are a good idea, nothing stops you from doing it though :)

## How does it work?

1. Using code from [plasma-active-window-control](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-active-window-control) widget for:
   1. Getting current window
   2. Maximize/unmaximize active window
2. Runs `qdbus org.kde.kglobalaccel /component/kwin org.kde.kglobalaccel.Component.invokeShortcut "ACTION NAME"` for all other actions
